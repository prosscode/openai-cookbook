 The Hermit Tarot card



The Hermit's Meaning
There are times in every life, when one must step back and make a careful examination of their situations and decisions. Finding the Hermit in your spread suggests this is just such a time for you. You are in need of a period of inner reflection, away from the current demands of your position. This retreat can be physical, or a search within. Only a deep and honest introspection will lead to a solution, however.


Past
The pace of your past has slowed, and it is time to accept this. Continue looking for your finals goals and consider the insight you have recently gained.
Present
There is someone who can help you through all your problems, and their insight may surprise you. This person is yourself. By understanding yourself, you can better understand others.
Future
When you become aware of your true road, there will be nothing to stand in your way. Life has challenged you, but you are prepared to make the best of the future.
Yes / No Key Interpretation
The Hermit is a card symbolic of seeking some sort of spiritual enlightenment. Solitary introspection and contemplation are also associated with the Hermit. Perhaps some soul-searching and reflection are required on your part. The answer to your question, therefore, is maybe.
