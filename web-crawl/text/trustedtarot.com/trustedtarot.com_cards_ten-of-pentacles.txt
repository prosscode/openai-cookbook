Ten of Pentacles's Meaning
Your financial security and emotional well-being are both positively indicated by the presence of this card in your spread. This is only partially your own doing, however, as these positive aspects are inextricably bound up in your close relationships with friends and family. It may also foretell an inheritance. 


Past
You have been prosperous and established a secure base by your ability to spend money wisely.
Present
You will receive a reward that is partially due to your efforts but also due to your position within your family. Carefully evaluate your own merits accordingly.
Future
An unexpected solution to a difficult financial problem will appear. The projects and ideas you are currently working on will be of benefit to future generations.
Yes / No Key Interpretation
The Ten of Pentacles shows the presence of stability, prosperity, and overall good fortune. This could all be due to having positive, close relationships or a tight-knit family as a foundation. An inheritance or discovery of treasure could await you, and your answer is yes.
