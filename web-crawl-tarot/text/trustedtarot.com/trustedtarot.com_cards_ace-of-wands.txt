 Ace of Wands Tarot card



Ace of Wands's Meaning
Drawing the Ace of Wands strongly suggests a new business enterprise being undertaken, traditionally, although some also interpret it to indicate childbirth. It speaks more strongly to the characteristics you will need to succeed in these new conditions. You will need to harness your potential for innovation, enthusiasm, and ambition to bring about a successful outcome. 


Past
Reexamine your past goals, as you are perhaps limiting yourself. There is inspiration building inside of you that will vent its energy destructively if you do not use it creatively.
Present
There is a new beginning at hand. It may take the form of a new phase of life, a new enterprise, a new project, or a new source of inspiration.
Future
To succeed, you must think clearly and plan ahead. There is a void in your life waiting to be filled, and it is your duty to fill it. Prepare for a transformative experience by filling this void with something to positively influence your new beginning.
Yes / No Key Interpretation
The Ace of Wands is an inventive, creative card suggesting some sort of passionate union, positive new beginnings, or the birth of something powerful and inspiring yet to come in your life. It could be a new project or something creative that you will be taking on. The answer to your question is most likely yes.
