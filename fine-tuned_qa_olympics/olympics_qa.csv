2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020年夏季オリンピック, Hepburn: Nisen Nijū-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad (第三十二回オリンピック競技大会, Dai Sanjūni-kai Orinpikku Kyōgi Taikai) and also known as Tokyo 2020 (東京2020, Tōkyō Nii Zero Nii Zero), was an international multi-sport event held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events that began on 21 July 2021. Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators. The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.The Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.
New events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.The United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals.

2020 Summer Olympics,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"In January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Summer Olympic Games. Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics. The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ""made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest"". Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event. Also unlike the case for H1N1 ""swine flu"" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020. In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate. In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.Estimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games. The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.",375,"2020 Summer Olympics

2020 Summer Olympics,Qualifying event cancellation and postponement,"Concerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China. The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3–14 February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March. The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia. The European boxing qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021. It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France, because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.",298,"2020 Summer Olympics

2020 Summer Olympics,Calls for cancellation,"Health experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist. In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori, asserted that the Games would be ""scrapped"" if they could not go ahead in 2021. On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games ""must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic"". Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was ""a mammoth task"" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021. However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.A member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a British Medical Journal editorial, which stated, ""holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes—ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security"".On 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had ""privately concluded"" that the Games would have to be cancelled. The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were ""categorically untrue"". The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled. It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.Public support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games, while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement. In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo ""have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity"" in an open letter to the prime minister.

Calls for cancellation

Health experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist. In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori, asserted that the Games would be ""scrapped"" if they could not go ahead in 2021. On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games ""must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic"". Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was ""a mammoth task"" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021. However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.A member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a British Medical Journal editorial, which stated, ""holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes—ignoring scientific and moral imperatives—is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security"".On 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had ""privately concluded"" that the Games would have to be cancelled. The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were ""categorically untrue"". The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled. It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.Public support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games, while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement. In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo ""have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity"" in an open letter to the prime minister. At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games. Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.Kenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to ""prioritise life"" over the Olympics.

In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.","1. What is the name of the country that will host the 2020 Summer Olympics?

2020 Summer Olympics,Torch relay,"The slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was ""Hope Lights Our Way"".As determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games, the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent. The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading ""Flame of Recovery"". After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.After the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021. On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia.

2020 Summer Olympics,Biosecurity protocols,"In February 2021, the IOC began releasing ""playbooks"" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from ""excessive"" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets. The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2021, for lacking ""scientifically rigorous risk assessment"" and failing to ""distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes"". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48 hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.The IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes ""jumping the queue"" in order to obtain priority over essential populations. On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete. On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.Approximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.Due to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators, and friends and family members of the athletes) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting. On 19 June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead. On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.On 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country. Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern. A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.On 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that ""it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections."" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that ""we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.""The announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas. The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries, while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well. School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.On 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo. However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.",1076,"2020 Summer Olympics

2020 Summer Olympics,New sports,"On 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are ""relevant to sports fans of all generations"", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 ""core"" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.The decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. The New York Times felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport. Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.On 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling. The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu. At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024.

The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020.

As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports.

Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision. After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as ""Neutral Athlete"" or ""Neutral Team"".

2020 Summer Olympics,Concerns and controversies,"Several controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid. In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games. The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjirō Sano, were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations. The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.Mass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction. In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.Portions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the ""Recovery Olympics"" (復興五輪, Fukkō Gorin). However, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed. Some Tōhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.It was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics, claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling ""historic scars and pain"" for people of Korea just as the swastika ""reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II"". Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor. According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, ""sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case by case basis."" Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.In February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshirō Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks. The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms, leading her to comment ""I regret it and think I should be careful"" on one of the accusations. The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki, resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe. Sasaki's replacement, Kentarō Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony, after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying ""Let's play Holocaust."" On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee, described Kobayashi's jokes as ""outrageous and unacceptable"", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.The composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome. On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies, but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July. The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the Dragon Quest series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom The Daily Beast described as ""notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist"", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.Officials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit. ""There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,"" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said, also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games. On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.Writing for The Conversation (website), Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians. As Ross explained, ""when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.""A number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1 August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management. Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety, Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4 August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.Near the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.",1397,"2020 Summer Olympics

2020 Summer Olympics,Broadcasting,"The Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total – representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.Sony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics. In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games. NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K. Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.The Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a ""right of abatement"" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to ""negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments"" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams. According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.In Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia. Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights. In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.In Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN. In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network. In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).",586,"2020 Summer Olympics

Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.The Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a ""right of abatement"" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to ""negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments"" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams. According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.In Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia. Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights. In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France Télévisions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.In Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN. In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network. In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).","1.

The boxing team trained with Australian consultant coach Don Abnett.The draw which determined the Filipino boxers' opponent was held on 22 July 2021.Three out of four boxers are guaranteed a medal. Irish Magno lost to Jutamas Jitpong in the round of 16 eliminating her from contention for a podium finish. She has previously defeated Jitpong in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games semifinals. Nesthy Petecio progressed all the way through the gold medal match but lost to Japanese boxer Sena Irie. Petecio became the first female Olympic medalist in boxing for the Philippines. Carlo Paalam and Eumir Marcial are guaranteed a medal, since they managed to advance to the semifinals in their events.","1.

Rio 2016 silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz finished second of the eight highest-ranked weightlifters in the women's 55 kg category based on the IWF Absolute World Rankings, with rookie Elreen Ando topping the field of weightlifters from the Asian zone in the women's 64 kg category based on the IWF Absolute Continental Rankings.Diaz is supported by Jeaneth Aro (sports nutritionist), Karen Trinidad (sports psychologist), Gao Kaiwen (head coach; from China), and Julius Naranjo (strength and conditioning mentor).She has been separated from her family since December 2019. In February 2020, Diaz went to Malaysia as part of her preparations for the Olympic Games as per advise of coach Gao. However she was left stranded in the country due to COVID-19 pandemic-related travel restrictions. Her training in Malaysia was also disrupted by the movement control order imposed in the country which affected the availability of gyms.Diaz, competing in the women's −55 kg, won the first-ever gold medal for the Philippines. She lifted 97 kg in the snatch and 127 kg in the clean and jerk for a total of 224 kg; bettering Liao Qiuyun of China by a single kilo. Her score in the clean and jerk and her overall total score established new Olympic records. It was also the first time Diaz was ever to perform a 127 kg lift in the clean and jerk, only able to successfully lift 125 kg while she was training.Diaz is the first Filipino competitor to win two consecutive Olympic medals since Teófilo Yldefonso in 1928 and 1932.
Elreen Ando on her part finished 7th on her event, but managed to set new Philippine national records in the snatch, clean and jerk, and total in her weight class.","1. What is the name of the weightlifter who won the first ever gold medal for the Philippines in the Olympics?

The first rider to set a fast time was Hugo Houle (Canada), with a time of 57:56.46. Stefan de Bod (South Africa) threatened his time but he eventually fell short by less than a second. No other rider in the first group threatened his time as Houle stayed in the hot seat until the next group of riders took to the course.
As the second group of riders started their rides, three riders challenged Houle's time: Remco Evenepoel (Belgium), Alberto Bettiol (Italy), and Rigoberto Urán (Colombia). At the first time check, Evenepoel was six seconds off Houle's time while Urán was 16 seconds down. Bettiol soon set the fastest time at the first time check, five seconds ahead of Houle. At the end of the first lap, Evenepoel and Urán were four and five seconds down on Houle, respectively. Meanwhile, Bettiol faded towards the end of the first lap, finishing the lap with a deficit of 21 seconds. All three riders began to edge ahead of Houle as they rode through the second lap. Evenepoel was the first rider to knock Houle off the top spot, finishing 35 seconds faster. Bettiol was almost 17 seconds slower than Evenepoel at the finish before Urán pushed Evenepoel into provisional second, finishing around two and a half seconds faster than the Belgian.
The final group of riders soon took to the course. The first rider to threaten Urán's time was Tom Dumoulin (Netherlands). Dumoulin was around 16 seconds faster than Bettiol's time at the first time check before his time was beaten by Primož Roglič (Slovenia), who was two and a half seconds faster. Rohan Dennis (Australia), Stefan Küng (Switzerland), and Wout van Aert (Belgium) were less than 10 seconds behind Roglič's time at the first time check before the world champion, Filippo Ganna (Italy), was half a second faster than Roglič. As the riders finished the first lap, Roglič ended up taking the top spot, with no other rider within eight seconds of his time. In the second lap, Roglič gradually built his advantage as he maintained his pace while the other riders began to fade. The battle for the silver and bronze medals also intensified as Dumoulin, Dennis, Küng, and Ganna were within five seconds of each other for most of the time. Kasper Asgreen (Denmark) and van Aert also faded in the second lap, losing considerable time. At the finish, Dumoulin was the first rider to knock Urán off the top spot, finishing more than a minute ahead. However, Roglič immediately beat Dumoulin's time as he finished with a time of 55:04.19, more than a minute ahead of Dumoulin. No one would threaten Roglič's time as he took the gold medal. Dennis came close to beating Dumoulin but he fell short by two and a half seconds to go into provisional third. Küng was also challenging the times of Dumoulin and Dennis before finishing at less than half a second from Dennis's time. The last rider to finish was Ganna. He eventually came in at almost two seconds down on Dennis, finishing without a medal.

The battle for the silver and bronze medals also intensified as Dumoulin, Dennis, Küng, and Ganna were within five seconds of each other for most of the time. Kasper Asgreen (Denmark) and van Aert also faded in the second lap, losing considerable time. At the finish, Dumoulin was the first rider to knock Urán off the top spot, finishing more than a minute ahead. However, Roglič immediately beat Dumoulin's time as he finished with a time of 55:04.19, more than a minute ahead of Dumoulin. No one would threaten Roglič's time as he took the gold medal. Dennis came close to beating Dumoulin but he fell short by two and a half seconds to go into provisional third. Küng was also challenging the times of Dumoulin and Dennis before finishing at less than half a second from Dennis's time. The last rider to finish was Ganna. He eventually came in at almost two seconds down on Dennis, finishing without a medal. Thus, the silver medal went to Dumoulin while the bronze medal went to Dennis.","1.

The first rider to set a benchmark time was Karol-Ann Canuel (Canada). She set a time of 33:07.97, which stood until Sarah Gigante (Australia) finished with a time of 33:01.60. Two riders, Leah Kirchmann (Canada) and Lisa Klein (Germany), came close to beating Gigante's time but both riders fell short by less than half a second. Gigante was eventually knocked off the top spot by Juliette Labous (France), who set the first time under 33 minutes with a time of 32:42.14. She was soon beaten by Ashleigh Moolman Pasio, who was four and a half seconds faster than Labous.
The favorites soon started the course, beginning with Amber Neben (United States). She set a time of 31:26.13, the first time under 32 minutes. However, just behind her, Annemiek van Vleuten (Netherlands) was speeding up the course. She was the fastest at both intermediate time checks before finishing with a time of 30:13.49, the only time under 31 minutes. Her time eventually stood until the end, winning the gold medal as a follow-up to her silver medal finish at the road race.

Meanwhile, Dygert struggled from the start as she was 51 seconds down at the first time check before eventually setting the seventh fastest time. At the second time check, van der Breggen and Reusser continued to lose time, going 29 and 42 seconds slower, respectively.

Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race,Summary,"The women's individual road race event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held on 25 July 2021 on a course starting at Musashinonomori Park in Tokyo and ending at the Fuji Speedway in Shizuoka Prefecture. 67 cyclists from 40 nations competed, with 48 completing the course.The race was won by rank outsider Anna Kiesenhofer of Austria. Kiesenhofer was part of the original breakaway, powering away at the very start of the race along with four other riders. She proceeded to drop her breakaway companions, all of whom were swallowed up by the peloton, soloing off the front at the Kagosaka Pass with 41 kilometres (25 mi) to go and holding off the late chase from the pack. She won by 1' 15"" over the silver medalist, Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands.
Van Vleuten made a late attack with 2.1 kilometres (1.3 mi) to go, distancing the remnants of the peloton.

Summary

The women's individual road race event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held on 25 July 2021 on a course starting at Musashinonomori Park in Tokyo and ending at the Fuji Speedway in Shizuoka Prefecture. 67 cyclists from 40 nations competed, with 48 completing the course.The race was won by rank outsider Anna Kiesenhofer of Austria. Kiesenhofer was part of the original breakaway, powering away at the very start of the race along with four other riders. She proceeded to drop her breakaway companions, all of whom were swallowed up by the peloton, soloing off the front at the Kagosaka Pass with 41 kilometres (25 mi) to go and holding off the late chase from the pack. She won by 1' 15"" over the silver medalist, Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands.
Van Vleuten made a late attack with 2.1 kilometres (1.3 mi) to go, distancing the remnants of the peloton. She celebrated after crossing the line, having mistakenly thought that all the breakaway riders had been caught and that she had won gold. The bronze medal went to Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy, after unsuccessfully attempting to bridge up to van Vleuten's attack and holding off the peloton.The Olympic road races are unusual in the modern professional circuit in the complete absence of team radios, an anomaly which, together with Kiesenhofer's relative anonymity in the peloton, factored heavily into the shock outcome of the 2021 race.

Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race,Qualification,"A National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to four qualified cyclists in the women's individual road race. All quota places are assigned to the NOC, which may select the cyclists that compete. There were 67 total quota spots available for the race. The assignments of spots to NOCs was a multi-stage process:

First, 62 places were assigned through the UCI world ranking by nations. This ranking included Elite and U-23 women's races for the 2019 season (22 October 2018 to 22 October 2019). The top five nations each received the maximum of four quota places: the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, the United States, and Australia. Nations ranked 6th through 13th each received three quota places, and 14th through 22nd each received two quota places.
Next, a special rule provided an opportunity for individuals ranked in the top 100 but whose nation was not in the top 22 to earn places (which would replace the lowest ranked nations). There were 17 eligible individuals. Their places were deducted from the lower-ranked nations: this reduced all of the 14th–22th nations to one quota place each and all of the 6th–13th nations to two places each.
Three more quota places were assigned through the 2019 African, Asian, and Pan-American championships; at each championship, among nations that were not yet qualified, the one with the highest placed road race cyclist earned a spot; these were taken by Ethiopia, South Korea, and Paraguay, respectively.
The final two quota places were reserved for the host nation; if the host nation had already earned one or two places, they would be reallocated through the UCI world rankings. In this case, Japan had earned one quota place through standard qualification, and so they received only one additional place, whereas the other was recovered by sixth-ranked Belgium. Because qualification was complete by 22 October 2019, this allocation was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shortly before the start of the games, Finnish cyclist Lotta Henttala withdrew from the race. She was replaced by Alison Jackson from eighth-ranked Canada. Likewise, Swedish competitor Emilia Fahlin withdrew and was replaced by Marta Lach from ninth-ranked Poland.",459,"Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race

Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race,Race overview,"As soon as the racing started, Anna Kiesenhofer (Austria) attacked from the peloton. She was soon joined by Carla Oberholzer (South Africa), Vera Looser (Namibia), Omer Shapira (Israel), and Anna Plichta (Poland). Several riders attempted to bridge to the front but they were caught by the peloton. The break was considered unthreatening, and was allowed to build a maximum advantage of around 11 minutes over the favourites before the gap was stabilized. As the road began to go uphill, Looser struggled to follow the pace in the break and she began to drop back. With 88 kilometres (55 mi) to go, Oberholzer also lost contact with her breakaway companions as three riders were left at the front. The trio up front managed to maintain their gap over the peloton as no teams were willing to take up the chase behind, leaning on the extremely strong Netherlands team who likewise failed to pursue. As the peloton neared the foot of the climb to Doushi Road, Emma Norsgaard Jørgensen (Denmark)'s wheel aligned with an expansion joint in the road causing her to lose control and crash. Annemiek van Vleuten (Netherlands) could not evade the fallen rider and went head over, both bicycles becoming entangled.  Both riders eventually got back up.
With around 61 kilometres (38 mi) to go, Demi Vollering (Netherlands) attacked from the peloton, sparking a flurry of attacks. However, all the moves were eventually covered while the break still enjoyed a lead of around eight and a half minutes. On the climb to Doushi Road, the lead began to come down as the pace in the peloton started to shed riders out the back. Around 51 kilometres (32 mi) from the finish, van Vleuten made another attack, this time building a gap over the peloton. At this point, the gap to the break up front still stood at around five and a half minutes. Van Vleuten managed to increase her lead to a minute over the peloton while up front, on the Kagosaka Pass, Kiesenhofer dropped Shapira and Plichta, going solo with 41 kilometres (25 mi) still left to race. Kiesenhofer maintained her five-minute advantage over van Vleuten on the descent from the Kagosaka Pass while the peloton was a further minute in arrears. As Kiesenhofer ended the descent, she still held a lead of four and a half minutes over the peloton. A few moments later, Juliette Labous (France) attacked from the peloton and gained a lead of around 20 seconds.
Kiesenhofer soon passed through the finish line at the Fuji Speedway for the first time with 17 kilometres (11 mi) to go, holding a lead of two minutes over Shapira and Plichta, almost four minutes over Labous, and more than four minutes over the peloton. At this point, Netherlands began to set a faster pace, bringing back Labous and closing in on Shapira and Plichta. With 4.5 kilometres (2.8 mi) left, both Shapira and Plichta were finally caught by the peloton; at this point, some of the riders, not having radios as is common in road cycling outside the Olympics, thought that all the breakaway riders had been caught, when in reality Kiesenhofer was still leading by three minutes. 2.1 kilometres (1.3 mi) from the finish, van Vleuten attacked from the peloton, with Elisa Longo Borghini (Italy) going after her. However, van Vleuten continued to maintain her gap over Longo Borghini while up front, but not catching the lone leader. Kiesenhofer soloed to the biggest win of her career, winning the gold medal.
Van Vleuten went on to take the silver medal. She celebrated as she crossed the line, thinking that she won the gold medal. There was controversy afterward because during the race, without radio communication, the organisation had not informed riders properly that Kiesenhofer was in the lead, or by how far.

Canada at the 2020 Summer Olympics,Summary,"Canada competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games were postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the nation's debut in 1900, Canadian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the country's support for United States-led boycott.
Before the official postponement, the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee initially announced their intention not to send teams to both the Olympics and Paralympics. Following the announcement on the postponement, the COC and CPC issued a statement that says, in part, that Team Canada ""will rise to the challenge to showcase our very best on the international stage,"" without explicitly saying that Canadian athletes will take part in the games.As part of the Canada Day celebrations held on Parliament Hill, Ottawa in 2019, former three time Olympic gold medalist in rowing, Marnie McBean was named as the Chef De Mission for the team.On July 13, 2021, the Canadian Olympic Committee officially announced the full team of 370 athletes (145 men and 225 women) competing in 30 sports, the largest team the country has sent to the games since Los Angeles 1984 and an increase of 56 from Rio 2016. 131 coaches will also accompany the team. A total of eight squads qualified in team sports, tied for the most ever with Montreal 1976. A total of 227 athletes competed at their first Olympics, and 134 of them returned from Rio 2016. On July 15, 2021, Vasek Pospisil withdrew from the tennis competitions, which reduced the team size to 370. On July 24, Annie Guglia received a reallocated spot in the women's street skateboarding event after an injury to a competitor from South Africa. This increased the team back to 371 athletes (145 men and 226 women).Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee announced in July 2021, that travelling alternates would be allowed to compete in the following team sports: field hockey, football (soccer), handball, rugby sevens and water polo.

Summary

Canada competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games were postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the nation's debut in 1900, Canadian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the country's support for United States-led boycott.
Before the official postponement, the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee initially announced their intention not to send teams to both the Olympics and Paralympics. Following the announcement on the postponement, the COC and CPC issued a statement that says, in part, that Team Canada ""will rise to the challenge to showcase our very best on the international stage,"" without explicitly saying that Canadian athletes will take part in the games.As part of the Canada Day celebrations held on Parliament Hill, Ottawa in 2019, former three time Olympic gold medalist in rowing, Marnie McBean was named as the Chef De Mission for the team.On July 13, 2021, the Canadian Olympic Committee officially announced the full team of 370 athletes (145 men and 225 women) competing in 30 sports, the largest team the country has sent to the games since Los Angeles 1984 and an increase of 56 from Rio 2016. 131 coaches will also accompany the team. A total of eight squads qualified in team sports, tied for the most ever with Montreal 1976. A total of 227 athletes competed at their first Olympics, and 134 of them returned from Rio 2016. On July 15, 2021, Vasek Pospisil withdrew from the tennis competitions, which reduced the team size to 370. On July 24, Annie Guglia received a reallocated spot in the women's street skateboarding event after an injury to a competitor from South Africa. This increased the team back to 371 athletes (145 men and 226 women).Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee announced in July 2021, that travelling alternates would be allowed to compete in the following team sports: field hockey, football (soccer), handball, rugby sevens and water polo. The alternates for these team sports are listed below and consisted of a further nine athletes (two in field hockey, four in soccer, one per rugby sevens and water polo teams). However, these nine do not officially count towards the team size. Canada's Olympic team contested all sports on the Olympic program except handball, modern pentathlon and surfing.

The first five events were quite different, with some level of consistency finally beginning with the 1932 event—which, though it had differences from the 1924 competition, was roughly similar. The 1936 competition followed the 1932 one quite closely. The post-World War II event substantially altered the competition once again.

Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol,Competition format,"The competition format will continue to use the two-round (qualifying round and final) format, as in 1988 and since 1996, with the final format introduced in 2012. The 2005 rules changes required the pistols used to be sport pistols, banning .22 Short cartridges.
The qualifying round from 1988 onward was essentially the same as the full competition format from 1948 to 1984. Each shooter fired 60 shots. These were done in two courses of 30; each course consisted of two stages of 15; each stage consisted of three series of 5. In each stage, the time limit for each series was 8 seconds for the first, 6 seconds for the second, and 4 seconds for the third. 
The 1988 tournament had added a two-series final for the top eight shooters; the 1992 competition broke that down to a four-series semifinal for the top eight and two-series final for the top four. In 1996 and 2000, the top eight once again advanced to the final. The 2004 version had reduced the number of finalists to six, where it stayed in 2008 and 2012.
Prior to 2008, the final involved two series of 5 shots at 4 seconds. In 2008, that was expanded to four series. The 2012 competition used an entirely different format, however, which remained in effect in 2016 and 2020. The competition switched to a ""hit-or-miss"" system, where a 9.7 or better scores as a ""hit"" for 1 point and anything lower scores as a ""miss"" for 0 points. The final featured 8 series of 5 shots each (5 points maximum per series, 40 points maximum total). However, starting with the fourth series, the remaining shooter with the lowest total was eliminated after each series (5 shooters remaining in the fifth series, 4 in the sixth, 3 in the seventh, and only 2 in the eighth and final series).
The 1992 competition had introduced round targets rather than the silhouettes used from 1948 to 1988 as well as many pre-World War II versions of the event. Score, rather than hits, had been used as the primary ranking method since 1960.",430,"Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol
Competition format

The competition format will continue to use the two-round (qualifying round and final) format, as in 1988 and since 1996, with the final format introduced in 2012. The 2005 rules changes required the pistols used to be sport pistols, banning .22 Short cartridges.
The qualifying round from 1988 onward was essentially the same as the full competition format from 1948 to 1984. Each shooter fired 60 shots. These were done in two courses of 30; each course consisted of two stages of 15; each stage consisted of three series of 5. In each stage, the time limit for each series was 8 seconds for the first, 6 seconds for the second, and 4 seconds for the third. 
The 1988 tournament had added a two-series final for the top eight shooters; the 1992 competition broke that down to a four-series semifinal for the top eight and two-series final for the top four. In 1996 and 2000, the top eight once again advanced to the final. The 2004 version had reduced the number of finalists to six, where it stayed in 2008 and 2012.
Prior to 2008, the final involved two series of 5 shots at 4 seconds. In 2008, that was expanded to four series. The 2012 competition used an entirely different format, however, which remained in effect in 2016 and 2020. The competition switched to a ""hit-or-miss"" system, where a 9.7 or better scores as a ""hit"" for 1 point and anything lower scores as a ""miss"" for 0 points. The final featured 8 series of 5 shots each (5 points maximum per series, 40 points maximum total). However, starting with the fourth series, the remaining shooter with the lowest total was eliminated after each series (5 shooters remaining in the fifth series, 4 in the sixth, 3 in the seventh, and only 2 in the eighth and final series).

The hammer throw is a track and field event in which the athlete throws a hammer as far as possible. The hammer is a smooth-surfaced metal implement, long and heavy, which is used to throw the implement. The hammer is thrown with one hand, and the athlete may use the hand to guide the hammer, or use two hands to catch the hammer and then release it. The hammer is usually thrown with the hand facing away from the athlete, but the athlete may turn the hand over to face the target.

The hammer throw is a track and field event in which competitors throw a hammer through an opening as far as possible. The hammer is a smooth-surfaced ball, usually made of steel, with a handle and a flat head. The thrower releases the hammer from a stand, and the hammer flies through the air. The hammer is released at a steep angle, and the hammer's speed increases rapidly as it leaves the hand. The hammer then falls to the ground, and the distance it travels depends on the weight of the hammer and the speed at which it leaves the hand.

The hammer is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of purposes. It is used in the sport of hammer throw, where the thrower uses the hammer to propel a metal ball through the air. The hammer is also used in the sport of weightlifting, where the weightlifter uses the hammer to lift a barbell from the ground to a standing position. The hammer"

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the period was suspended from 6 April 2020 to 30 November 2020, with the end date extended to 29 June 2021.

The world rankings, based on the average of the best five results for the athlete over the qualifying period and weighted by the importance of the meet, will then be used to qualify athletes until the cap of 32 is reached.The qualifying period was originally from 1 May 2019 to 29 June 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the period was suspended from 6 April 2020 to 30 November 2020, with the end date extended to 29 June 2021. The world rankings period start date was also changed from 1 May 2019 to 30 June 2020; athletes who had met the qualifying standard during that time were still qualified, but those using world rankings would not be able to count performances during that time. The qualifying time standards could be obtained in various meets during the given period that have the approval of the IAAF. Both outdoor and indoor meets are eligible. The most recent Area Championships may be counted in the ranking, even if not during the qualifying period.NOCs can also use their universality place—each NOC can enter one female athlete regardless of time if they had no female athletes meeting the entry standard for an athletics event—in the javelin throw.","1.

There were two distinct rounds of jumping with results cleared between rounds. Jumpers were eliminated if they had three consecutive failures, whether at a single height or between multiple heights if they attempted to advance before clearing a height.
The qualifying round had the bar set at various heights up to a qualifying standard of 2.30 metres. All jumpers clearing that standard advanced to the final. A minimum of 12 jumpers advanced; if fewer than 12 achieved the qualifying standard, the top 12 (including ties after use of the countback rules) would advance.

The top 4 spots, regardless of geographic zone, qualify (ROC, Italy, France, and the United States). The next four spots are allocated to separate geographic zones, as long as an NOC from that zone is in the top 16. These places went to Japan (Asia/Oceania), Canada (Americas), Egypt (Africa), and Hungary (Europe).Additionally, there are 8 host/invitational spots that can be spread throughout the various fencing events. Because Japan qualified a women's team through normal team qualification, it did not need to use any host quota places for women's team foil.

Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon,Qualification,"Approximately 80 athletes were initially expected to compete (target number of 80) by entry time or ranking; the final number was 110 runners qualified by time, with NOCs universality places yet to enter athletes in addition to the 110 qualifying through time, much more than the expected due to the postponed Games (4 universality places were used in 2016). The qualification period for the entry standard (2:11:30) was from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2021, with a maximum quota of 3 athletes per National Olympic Committee. Performances achieved between 6 April 2020 and 30 November 2020 were not considered in the qualification system.A National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 3 qualified athletes in the men's marathon if all athletes meet the entry standard or qualify by ranking during the qualifying period. (The limit of 3 has been in place since the 1930 Olympic Congress.) The qualifying standard is 2:11:30. This standard was ""set for the sole purpose of qualifying athletes with exceptional performances unable to qualify through the IAAF World Rankings pathway."" Runners in the top 10 at the 2019 world championship, the top 5 at any IAAF Gold Label marathon, and the top 10 at the Marathon Major Series were deemed to have met the qualifying standard, regardless of actual time. The world rankings, based on the average of the best five results for the athlete over the qualifying period and weighted by the importance of the meet, will then be used to qualify athletes until the cap of 80 is reached. More than 80 athletes (after application of the 3 per NOC rule) have met the qualifying standard.
To be a qualifying performance, the course had to have been certified in the last five years by a Grade A or Grade B road course measurer. In order to be eligible for the qualifying standard time, the elevation decrease could not be more than 1 metre per kilometre. For world rankings, the elevation decrease could exceed that rate, but a correction would be made to the score.The qualifying period was originally from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the period was suspended from 6 April 2020 to 30 November 2020, with the end date extended to 31 May 2021. The world rankings period start date was also changed from 1 January 2019 to 1 December 2018. The qualifying time standards could be obtained in various meets during the given period that have the approval of the IAAF. The most recent Area Championships may be counted in the ranking, even if not during the qualifying period. In July 2020, World Athletics announced that the suspension period would be lifted for the road events (marathons and race walks) on 1 September 2020.NOCs can also use their universality place—each NOC can enter one male athlete regardless of time if they had no male athletes meeting the entry standard for an athletics event—in the marathon.Qualification ended on 31 May 2021.

Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's rhythmic individual all-around,Controversy in Russia,"The final result of the competition was considered controversial in Russia, as Israeli gold medalist Linoy Ashram dropped her apparatus during her ribbon routine. The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) claims that she didn't receive a significant deduction (despite the fact that she did get a 0.700 deduction), which would have otherwise changed the standing due to the narrow score difference between Ashram and Russian silver medalist Dina Averina. Meanwhile, Olympic judges and supporters of Ashram note that Ashram's combined overall difficulty was over a point (+1.000) higher than Averina, allowing Ashram to score well even had she received a 1.000 point deduction for dropping the apparatus.After the results were in, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) coaches submitted an inquiry on Dina Averina's ribbon score, but the score was left unchanged. Averina commented that she believed the judges were supporting Ashram and punishing herself, and she considers herself the champion. This position was universally supported by the Russian state-controlled media, which stated that Averina was the victim of ""political games"" and was purposefully denied gold, referring to it as ""the conspiracy against Russia"".
Their claims were dismissed by the international governing body, the FIG (International Gymnastics Federation), which confirmed that the FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee carried out a post-competition review of all evaluation components in every phase of the rhythmic gymnastics competition at Tokyo 2020. They stated:""Following this process, we can confirm that no bias or irregularities were identified in the judging panels. The Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee, therefore, confirms that the rankings and results of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games competitions in rhythmic gymnastics for both individuals and groups are fair and impartial.
The FIG has set up strict criteria for objective selection of the most qualified and unbiased judges for the Olympic Games and we are pleased by their work.""",397,"Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's rhythmic individual all-around

The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) claims that she didn't receive a significant deduction (despite the fact that she did get a 0.700 deduction), which would have otherwise changed the standing due to the narrow score difference between Ashram and Russian silver medalist Dina Averina. Meanwhile, Olympic judges and supporters of Ashram note that Ashram's combined overall difficulty was over a point (+1.000) higher than Averina, allowing Ashram to score well even had she received a 1.000 point deduction for dropping the apparatus.After the results were in, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) coaches submitted an inquiry on Dina Averina's ribbon score, but the score was left unchanged. Averina commented that she believed the judges were supporting Ashram and punishing herself, and she considers herself the champion. This position was universally supported by the Russian state-controlled media, which stated that Averina was the victim of ""political games"" and was purposefully denied gold, referring to it as ""the conspiracy against Russia"".
Their claims were dismissed by the international governing body, the FIG (International Gymnastics Federation), which confirmed that the FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee carried out a post-competition review of all evaluation components in every phase of the rhythmic gymnastics competition at Tokyo 2020. They stated:""Following this process, we can confirm that no bias or irregularities were identified in the judging panels. The Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee, therefore, confirms that the rankings and results of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games competitions in rhythmic gymnastics for both individuals and groups are fair and impartial.
The FIG has set up strict criteria for objective selection of the most qualified and unbiased judges for the Olympic Games and we are pleased by their work.""","1. What is the difference between a ""dance"" and a ""gymnastics"" routine?

Artistic swimming at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's duet,Competition format,"The preliminary phase consisted of a free routine, then a technical routine with required elements. The scores from the two routines were added together and the top twelve duets qualified for the final. The final repeated the same free routine and the score from the final free routine was added to the score from the preliminary technical routine to decide the overall winners. Both preliminary free and technical routines starting lists were decided by random draw. For the final however, two groups were made: the last six and the first six qualified duets, the former group starting first.The technical routine must be completed in between 2 minutes 5 seconds and 2 minutes 35 seconds. There are 3 panels of 5 judges for each routine. In the technical routine, one panel each considers execution (30% of score), impression (30%), and elements (40%). The execution and impression judges each give a single score, while the elements judges give a score for each element. Scores are between 0 and 10, with 0.1 point increments. The highest and lowest score from each panel (including within each element, for the elements panel) are discarded. The remaining scores are averaged and weighted by the percentage for that panel, with element scores weighted within the element panel by degree of difficulty. The maximum possible score is 100. In addition to a lift, jump, or throw (which can be placed anywhere in the routine, there are 5 required elements, which must be done in order:

Fencing at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's foil,Competition format,"The 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2020 tournament will continue to use that format. Fencing is done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reaches 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer is the winner; a tie results in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period.

Competition format

The 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2020 tournament will continue to use that format. Fencing is done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reaches 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer is the winner; a tie results in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period.

Bouts consist of three three-minute rounds with a one-minute break between rounds. A boxer may win by knockout or by points.
